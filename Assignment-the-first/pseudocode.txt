Open fastq files
Open barcodes.txt
For length of barcodes.txt:
        Open output fastq file


Loop through 4 files
        Make 4 lists for each record (one per file)
If N is in the index OR index not in index-list
        Append index to header
        Put in low quality output file
Revcomp function


If indexes are the same
        Append index to header
        Put in index file
Else
        Append index to header
        Put in swap file


Reportnum function


Close all files


High level functions


Def revcomp(index):
‘’’Takes index, writes complementary strand to it, and then reverses it to get it in 5’ - 3’ direction. Returns the output reverse complement of index.’’’
Return reverse complement of "index"
Example input: ACTG
Output: CAGT


Def reportnum(file, category):
‘’’Takes output file and counts the number of read-pairs included in that file’s category. Categories include: “match”, “swap”, “unknown” if the category is swap, function will also return number of unique index combinations.’’’
return string with number of a certain type of index found and what type (match, swap, or unknown) the count is from.

Example input: FASTQ file with 5 properly matched indexes, “match”
Output: “5 matched indexes in FASTQ file”
Example input: FASTQ file with 3 swapped indexes (2 same, 1 unique), “swap”
Output: “3 swapped indexes, 2 AAA CCC, 1 AAA TTT”
